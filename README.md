# Project 3 Generative Visual - BigGAN generated Spotify song videos

Caleb Kirilov, ckirlov2@huskers.unl.edu

## Abstract

Spotify has an artist feature for a custom seven second video loop to replace a song's album art while viewing a song on the phone app in fullscreen. I personally find the feature annoying, however, keeping with my class theme of generative musicians I thought this would be a perfect application for BigGAN truncation videos. I plan to make one to accompany my project 2 generation assisted song.

## Model/Data

Files that are included with the repository:
- Images for BigGAN to ingest for truncation
- Potentially, similar Spotify examples

## Code

Languages used in the project and their notebook names:
- Jupyter notebooks: BigGAN_handson.ipynb

//## Results

//Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
//- image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
//- move files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
//- ... some other form

//## Technical Notes

//Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
//- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
//- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
